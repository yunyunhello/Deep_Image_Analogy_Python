# Description

This is a project based on [caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) and MSRA's [Deep Image Analogy](https://github.com/msracver/Deep-Image-Analogy/tree/linux)

I am trying to modify the project [Deep Image Analogy](https://github.com/msracver/Deep-Image-Analogy/tree/linux) from C version to python version.
