# Description

This is a project based on [caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) and MSRA's [Deep Image Analogy](https://github.com/msracver/Deep-Image-Analogy/tree/linux)

I am trying to modify the project [Deep Image Analogy](https://github.com/msracver/Deep-Image-Analogy/tree/linux) from C version to python version.

Note: For the consistence of my repo name, I name this project "caffe" temporarily. After I finish it, I will change it.
In addition, I am a greener in github, if there is anything involved with your copyright, please tell me. I will delete it soon.
Thanks a lot!
